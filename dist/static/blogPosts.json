While it was certainly not the only important thing (even that day), I also had an Information Retrieval project due that morning, and a Lithium technologies interview a few hours before hand. Luckily a lot of the studying I do for Downings tests translate well into technical interviews. I felt it went really well, it was only one fairly simple programming problem that I finished in a little less than 15 minutes of the hour long interview. My Information Retrieval project was very interesting, the projects always give me some worry on completion though because I can never make it to office hours and I don't really know anyone in the class so I am truly muscling through them on my own."

Following that I have a research playback at IBM for my radical collaboration course in which I have not been able to heavily participate in due to my hectic schedule. And then on Thursday I have a midterm in Information Retrieval. It's the only midterm, which always worries me since you have no chance to improve on a second one given the layout of the test. I will also be missing a test prep/review class period due to my hence mentioned doctors visit. AND THEN after that I will have to run to the airport to fly to Seattle for an onsite Amazon interview. I'm pretty stoked to visit Seattle for the first time and looking forward to the interview, but its stressful when it come after all of that."

I don't really understand how people in other majors are able to make it through their classes without having something about it that they really really enjoy. For me I find my CS specific classes so interesting, but more than that the knowledge I gain from them opens up a world for me to find even more interesting things than are offered here. One thing I find really fascinating is the ability to use code to visually express complex ideas. This past week I discovered a guy who made vizualizations of repetition in songs using self-similarity matrices. You can check them out at this address -> https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/ <-. Being able to just go out on the internet and find so many people doing such neat and interesting things simply because they enjoy programming and making little discoveries is why I love CS so much."

This is a design pattern that involves creating the smallest parts of your component structure 'atoms' and building up from there to 'molecules', and 'organisms'. This kind of design pattern makes building new components easier for you and for others on the project. Basically its like making legos out of your application, a bunch of little building blocks that you can use later on to build cool things. If you aren't convinced heres a link with 10 reasons you too should use Atomic Design -- http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/10-reasons-you-should-be-using-atomic-design-61620771"

I feel like the requirements are all over the place and unclear in a lot of ways. While we were working in the lab today we had another group come up and ask us stuff about the project. They asked how we set up react and the database, we however were certain neither of those things were required for the first project and told them such. We later were told by another group that we did need to use react for part 1 of idb. After posting on Piazza, we found out this was not the case and told that group as well. The fact that 3 groups had different ideas about what part 1 was speaks to the layout of this project. Doing a static site first with fake data, but not requiring react, which will later be an integral part is strange which is why I believe it was so unclear. The layout of a site using a component based framework is VASTLY different than a static HTML only site. We are going to have to spend many man hours just reworking our site and componetizing parts before we can move on in the next project. I feel as though this project should have started with us getting a simple one page HTML site up and running using flask and Google Cloud Platform. Something as simple as the team name and photos. Then the next project should have been building out the API and model structure of the site. After fully understanding the data layout of the project we could properly design the site and componetize the application, so the third project could be building out the front-end with React. This layout of this project makes far more sense to me from my experience as a web developer. An MVP shouldn't be so different from the final form that it is almost unusable or requiring manual effort to copy and past html into React components. I am really excited for this project but the cluttered structure has made many of the parts feel confusing or 'for the sake of doing them' and not actually teaching us something about development."

Whether its for the best or not the way our current recruiting system works favors those who practice one-off style algo and data structures problems. The more of these problems you do the better mindset you are in to tackle these types of complex bite-sized problems. I find that working or personal projects (the type of development most of us will do after school) doesn't lend itself to performing well in interviews so we need to supplement this with extra practice.

However after working this summer my thoughts around all of the scaffolding in the project have changed. When working on stories for work we go through the process of  estimating time, assigning champions to task them out, and giving them story points. In this class the process is quite different than in the workplace, its far more granular. If implementing a feature that found the max cycle length of a number the story would be more like this: Collatz would have a story point value of difficulty, probably a 1 - 3 just given where I worked. Then the story would have a simple description of the functionality and a set of 'acceptance criteria' to let you know the type of output it would have when finished. Then the champion would create subtasks which would be similar to our issues but more general; 1. Set up repository and CI  2. Write unit and acceptance tests  3. Implement logic  4. Manual testing (if necessary)  5. Code review  6. Deploy. The act of writing out a minimum of 15 issues is tedious and often ends up with the developer creating things simply for the sake of the task. I think the problem may be in that this project is supposed to simulate what an entire 'product' would look like when it is more the workload of a light story so coming up with all the subtasks seems extraneous. However the practice for anyone who has never had any experience doing something like this is better than nothing, it certainly taught me better in OOP. However I feel like the granularity of these projects pull people away from taking the skill into their own projects, and will end up with them worrying too much doing it wrong later in their career. I look forward to it in the web application though, however as that will be much more similar to a 'product'"

My tip (and sort of self promotion) is to find people similar to your age or position in life working on projects and help out with those. Working on open source doesn't always have to mean workin on some big product, finding a small, maybe less 'important' project can help get you started. Even similar to this is to be the catalyst to creating small projects, when you work on a project make it open source! Typically this is as easy as ensuring the code is on github and writing documentation on what you are doing. This is something I have been trying to do with all of my hobby projects, I am currently working on a small css-framework called KentCSS that I have open and avaliable to the public. I write documentation on the classes and am working on submission guidelines and tips to help people work on it if they find it interesting. Open source is more of an idea than a set of projects, help promote the culture of open source through all of your development!"
