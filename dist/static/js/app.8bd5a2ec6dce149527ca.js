I will say before I get into my whole course review that Downing is the only instructor that I have had that understands how computer science should be taught. I have long had a problem with many of my CS courses because they strive to be extremely academic, and while we are certainly at an academic institution, CS benefits so uniquely from a practical instruction. So while I will mention some flaws I felt were present in the course, I commend Downing. Often we can be the most critical of people doing great things because we get a glimpse of perfection."},{title:"",body:"A typical class day starts with a Canvas based quiz over either topics from previous classes or weekly readings. The quizzes are a great way to keep people on their toes, and thinking about the course day-to-day, however sometimes they can feel contrived and as if they are made specifically to catch you. With this said Downing is far more than fair in giving leniency to the quiz grades (considering we are on quiz 40 and he only grades the top 30 or so). The lectures are more often than not very engaging, Downing has a real excitement about a lot of his material and it really helps to let you see the importance of what he is teaching ('This is a high point of the God damn class!'). The portions of the course in which we are coving Python were top notch, they were easy to understand, felt like they progressed off of one another, and actually made me want to go home and write toy code after class. The topics after Python, however (SQL and Refactoring specifically) were far dryer and the layout and progression often left me confused. I never had those 'I could use that to do X' moments like I did with Python that got me really excited about the course, and I think it had a lot to do with how he went through the material. The SQL lectures felt like a bunch of disjoint and abstract examples rather than good descriptions of things we could do with the tool. Having to juggle knowledge about the tables or the previous code base (refactoring) had me spending more time figuring out what went where and why rather than understanding the topic or imagining possibilities with a feature."},{title:"",body:"Beyond the scope of the actual class period (which makes up a much larger portion of the time you will spend with this class), there were the '2' projects. The first was normal, easy, and honestly, I don't think worth spending any time talking about. The 'second' project is what people come to this class for, IDB or the 'imdb but not imdb something else' project. This project was probably the most time-consuming project I have had since OS, luckily it is nowhere near the difficulty but the time commitment is something to make note of. You are gathered into a simulated 'sprint team' or 5 or 6 where you embark upon the journey of 'making a website just like in industry but where the requirements from your PM are really bad and the timescale is super short'. I really want to give Downing props for taking on the endeavor of trying to create a project that simulates what real work is like, and he comes pretty close, but there are some big holes that could use some work. The project starts with a 'rush job' sort of part 1, where you have to piece together a prototype of your site, except you actually have to code it and spend a bunch of time doing work that you would NEVER EVER have to do in industry. I am all for prototyping, I do it for every single project I have ever worked on, but this is exactly what every book on design process says what NOT TO DO when you prototype. The start of a project should be for planning, creating diagrams, low-fidelity mockups, and a road-map of your MVP. Even in Agile work environments, you don't immediately start on coding. You do a Spike on a tech stack, your PM spends tons of time road-mapping and creating stories, your discuss the right technologies, database design and tons more. If we had been given 2 weeks to ONLY create a plan for the structure of the database early concepts of the UI, and creating a backlog of stories and prioritizing them we would have been aptly prepared to take on this project and it would have been no big deal at all (that's not to say that the project was very hard, but many roadblocks along the way could have been sorted out beforehand and would have in a normal Agile environment). After the beginning of the project, it was much smoother, a lot of work had to be put in on part 2 but we got through it. I would say my next biggest complaint after the early stages was that the teams become too sequestered. If you were busier during the 1st or 2nd part you usually got stuck doing the worse work like data-scraping, and if you started on front-end or back-end you usually stay doing that because you now have the base level knowledge so you can just do it quicker. If we had more time on each part, or maybe had planning time at the beginning to have a better idea of what needed to be done and when it would have been easier to have people dipping their toes in every end. I know I left this project with zero ideas of what is going on in the API since I had the most knowledge of front-end technologies. Overall I did enjoy this project, I was in a great group of friends so we all got along and communicated really well, yet I have a strong feeling that this would have devolved into a typical college group project had I not had such a strong connection with my group, due to a lot of the ambiguities and siloing of team members."},{title:"",body:"If you have not had an internship, this class will take you leaps and bounds forwards (OOP too), and if you have this might help to fill some gaps. If you have never done web development this will give you a great 'throw you in the deep end' introduction, and if you have already then this will push what you think you know and test how efficient you are at doing it. Thank you, Downing, for taking the time to teach CS in a way that provides so much value to us students going straight into the workforce. You are on the precipice of greatness and should be an inspiration to other professors here in the CS department. Do not stop what you are doing, I know I was more critical than positive in my review but the students here gain so much from it and I really enjoyed it (it could just use a little bit of tweaking (; )."},{title:"Thank you Downing!",body:""}]},{id:"11192017",title:"Week 12",subtitle:"The End Draws Close",date:"November 19, 2017",content:[{title:"What did you do this past week?",body:"This past week I turned in my PageRank information retrieval project, gave a playback on the concept ideas for my IBM project, and then rounded off the week with some relaxation."},{title:"What's in your way?",body:"Currently I'm closing in on a corner for accepting a full-time offer.

If you are interested in front-end development one of the best thing you can do is to have knowledge of a ton of technologies (can I hear a 'JS fatigue'??), and my current favorite is Vue. If you have been using React in IDB and feel sometimes like its a bit messy, or feels confusing sometimes, then Vue is just for you. Vue gives a bit more structure and opinionated design choices than react, while still giving you tons of flexibility in your own choices. Its lightweight and super quick just like React, and can be used piecemeal or for a huge project."}]},{id:"11122017",title:"Week 11",subtitle:"A Real Team",date:"November 12, 2017",content:[{title:"What did you do this past week?",body:"IDB 3! We spent the past weekend and early week putting in a ton of time on gamingdb. I spent most of my working on search on the frontend, but also putting in a decent amount of time to styling sorting/filtering and improving upon some problems we had in the site after part 2. One of the big things I wanted to fix was having routing history on our pagination, so when you used the browser back button after clicking on a game or paging, it would take you to where you actually were before, rather than the first page. Search for the page was a big beast though that took most of my time. Specifically since it had so many moving parts. Search was a bit complex as a request due to how it was implemented on the back end, which was tough, but it also required the list display, tabbing over the different models, and paging within each of the model sets. Oh and also highlighting the text from all of the models and displaying them in a meaningful way was more complex than I felt it would be at the beginning of the project."},{title:"What's in your way?",body:"Big projects are piling up at this point of the semester, so balancing when to work on what is tough.

Also I have 2 different groups to meet up with for different projects so planning often has to be a sacrafice of free-time or breaking into the other projects 'time'"},{title:"What will you do next week?",body:"I have to finish up and turn in my PageRank project for IR and give my next project playback at IBM. Once both of those are done I'll be able to slip into a bit of a more normal routine."},{title:"What's my experience of the class?",body:"Right now I am not enjoying it that much. I wouldn't say its because of the content but because of how it is all presented. Python and Regex and OO principals have been topics I already have knowledge in so if the teaching style hasn't really changed and I'm only noticing it now its because SQL is actually more new to me, especially the more advanced nuances. What I am talking about is that class is just a presentation of examples. I feel like we never get a good description of actual features of SQL we are just shown a bunch of seemingly contrived examples and expected to learn something important about SQL. I don't feel like I ever have the opportunity to reflect in class about how I personally would use a 'feature' of SQL and actually have complex thoughts about it. I wish we were given the chance to learn about WHY we do certain things not just being shown how it is done in one or two examples. Also I think this is heightened because the examples feel really disjoint since we also have to have knowledge of all of the tables, so much of the limited time we have between examples is spent wondering why you used the Apply table or whatever. I usually really enjoy coming to this class and learning, but I have had a really hard time recently."},{title:"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?",body:"I'm a strong believer that productivity tools are really valuable to developers, whether this is build in editor tools, IDE's, shortcut keys, or whatever. One of my favorite things is the a visor mode terminal. This makes it to where you can 'summon' your terminal anytime on your computer with a shortcut. I use iterm2, where I have a secondary profile called 'visor' that has a shortcut key Alt + Space that allows it to appear from the top of my screen over any windows, and then disappears when I click away or use the hotkey again. It is really valuable to me when I am running scripts often through the commandline, since I don't have to have it fullscreened and swipe over to it or search through my open apps.

I know CSS can be daunting and confusing at the start but there are a ton of great resources and pre-existing styles out there.

Since we should start having very polished looking websites I think it would be good to give a quick tip on how to improve user experience overall. One really simple thing you can do to improve your websites interface is to add whitespace. White space isn't just actual 'white' space, but parts of the page that are completely devoid of any type of information. When you increase your whitespace you typcially will increase readability and declutter the visual space. Especially in a project like this one where we are required to display a lot of information if you try to cram all of that information together your user will not be able to quickly parse the information or find what is valuable. Certainly this tip is not a 'catch-all' and you shouldn't just immense white space for no reason, but if you are looking at your content and it feels like it needs something to look better, try adding some extra white space and that may be a quick way to improve it. (P.S. Do NOT use images as backgrounds, this is really distracting and makes text and components really hard to decypher)"}]},{id:"10152017",title:"Week 7",subtitle:"Examination Complete",date:"October 15, 2017",content:[{title:"What did you do this past week?",body:"This past week was highlighted by the test!

I felt it went really well, it was only one fairly simple programming problem that I finished in a little less than 15 minutes of the hour long interview.

I think we are all really lucky to be in a major and career field that has such a wide reach.

For me I find my CS specific classes so interesting, but more than that the knowledge I gain from them opens up a world for me to find even more interesting things than are offered here. One thing I find really fascinating is the ability to use code to visually express complex ideas. This past week I discovered a guy who made vizualizations of repetition in songs using self-similarity matrices. You can check them out at this address -> https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/ <-.

The project is a bit sporadic. I feel like the requirements are all over the place and unclear in a lot of ways. While we were working in the lab today we had another group come up and ask us stuff about the project. They asked how we set up react and the database, we however were certain neither of those things were required for the first project and told them such. We later were told by another group that we did need to use react for part 1 of idb. After posting on Piazza, we found out this was not the case and told that group as well. The fact that 3 groups had different ideas about what part 1 was speaks to the layout of this project. Doing a static site first with fake data, but not requiring react, which will later be an integral part is strange which is why I believe it was so unclear. The layout of a site using a component based framework is VASTLY different than a static HTML only site. We are going to have to spend many man hours just reworking our site and componetizing parts before we can move on in the next project. I feel as though this project should have started with us getting a simple one page HTML site up and running using flask and Google Cloud Platform. Something as simple as the team name and photos. Then the next project should have been building out the API and model structure of the site. After fully understanding the data layout of the project we could properly design the site and componetize the application, so the third project could be building out the front-end with React. This layout of this project makes far more sense to me from my experience as a web developer. An MVP shouldn't be so different from the final form that it is almost unusable or requiring manual effort to copy and past html into React components. I am really excited for this project but the cluttered structure has made many of the parts feel confusing or 'for the sake of doing them' and not actually teaching us something about development."},{title:"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?",body:"My tip of the week is to 'reinvent the wheel' as often as you can! Many people talk about this as if it is a bad thing or a waste of time. However as students and upcoming developers I believe it is our duty to try to copy or recreate the things we use to develop, so that we can truly understand why they do things the way they do or how they work.

The more of these problems you do the better mindset you are in to tackle these types of complex bite-sized problems.

Right now its a bit dry since I took OOP and this project is the same as our starter project in that class. However after working this summer my thoughts around all of the scaffolding in the project have changed. When working on stories for work we go through the process of  estimating time, assigning champions to task them out, and giving them story points. In this class the process is quite different than in the workplace, its far more granular. If implementing a feature that found the max cycle length of a number the story would be more like this: Collatz would have a story point value of difficulty, probably a 1 - 3 just given where I worked. Then the story would have a simple description of the functionality and a set of 'acceptance criteria' to let you know the type of output it would have when finished. Then the champion would create subtasks which would be similar to our issues but more general; 1. Set up repository and CI  2. Write unit and acceptance tests  3. Implement logic  4. Manual testing (if necessary)  5. Code review  6. Deploy. The act of writing out a minimum of 15 issues is tedious and often ends up with the developer creating things simply for the sake of the task. I think the problem may be in that this project is supposed to simulate what an entire 'product' would look like when it is more the workload of a light story so coming up with all the subtasks seems extraneous. However the practice for anyone who has never had any experience doing something like this is better than nothing, it certainly taught me better in OOP. However I feel like the granularity of these projects pull people away from taking the skill into their own projects, and will end up with them worrying too much doing it wrong later in their career. I look forward to it in the web application though, however as that will be much more similar to a 'product'"},{title:"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?",body:"Contributing to open source is extremely valuable, but can be really scary to students or feel overwhelming. My tip (and sort of self promotion) is to find people similar to your age or position in life working on projects and help out with those. Working on open source doesn't always have to mean workin on some big product, finding a small, maybe less 'important' project can help get you started. Even similar to this is to be the catalyst to creating small projects, when you work on a project make it open source! Typically this is as easy as ensuring the code is on github and writing documentation on what you are doing. This is something I have been trying to do with all of my hobby projects, I am currently working on a small css-framework called KentCSS that I have open and avaliable to the public. I write documentation on the classes and am working on submission guidelines and tips to help people work on it if they find it interesting. Open source is more of an idea than a set of projects, help promote the culture of open source through all of your development!"}]},{id:"09042017",title:"Week 1",subtitle:"Beginning of the End",date:"September 4, 2017",content:[{title:"What are your expectations of the class?",body:"As the first week of class has finished it is really starting to hit me that I am in my final year. Having now been programming for 3 years my main goal for taking SWE is to solidify good practices and proper techniques in my code. I have used many of the technologies or some variant of them through personal projects or internships, but with more practice comes better and better results. I also am looking forward to becoming proficient in python. While I have worked in the language before, I look forward to Downings very in depth look at the language. I know I learned a great deal about C++ in OOP, and I hope to get that deep into Python as well."},{title:"What did you do this past week?",body:"This past week was quite an easy one, every class was introductions, syllbi, and maybe a intro lecture. I did get a good feel of the majority of my classes so I have been working to prepare myself for the routine I will soon be deeply entrenched in."},{title:"What's in your way?",body:"Currently my school life is smooth sailing, so there aren't really any blockers this week. I do have one class that is only on tuesdays, that I for obvious reasons did not attend, so I am still curious to find out how that class will be."},{title:"What will you do next week?",body:"This upcoming week is where things begin to get real. I will start to form real routines and figure out the time scheduling for all of my classes work."},{title:"What's my experience of the class?",body:"I have taken OOP in the past and so SWE feel very familiar. I was dissapointed to see that the groups for the large project will be randomly assigned, as this project was a large reason for taking this class. I get that the random teams is supposed to simulate 'real life' better, but here where a big portion of it is coming up with the idea (unlike a real job where the idea is typically already with the team) I feel like it will stifle the creativity we will have. I think this because I wanted to go in with friends and acquaintances who have similar interests so we could work on something we all know a lot about and therefore be more creative."},{title:"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?",body:"My tip of the week is to make sure that you are really paying attention to you classes during syllabus week so you can figure out the work load and schedule you will have to keep throughout the semester. Blocking your time early and preparing yourself can make school feel alot less stressful once the work actually begins."}]}]}},cMo0:function(e,t){},dPB5:function(e,t,a){"use strict";var
