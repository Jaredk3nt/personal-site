The project is a bit sporadic. I feel like the requirements are all over the place and unclear in a lot of ways. While we were working in the lab today we had another group come up and ask us stuff about the project. They asked how we set up react and the database, we however were certain neither of those things were required for the first project and told them such. We later were told by another group that we did need to use react for part 1 of idb. After posting on Piazza, we found out this was not the case and told that group as well. The fact that 3 groups had different ideas about what part 1 was speaks to the layout of this project. Doing a static site first with fake data, but not requiring react, which will later be an integral part is strange which is why I believe it was so unclear. The layout of a site using a component based framework is VASTLY different than a static HTML only site. We are going to have to spend many man hours just reworking our site and componetizing parts before we can move on in the next project. I feel as though this project should have started with us getting a simple one page HTML site up and running using flask and Google Cloud Platform. Something as simple as the team name and photos. Then the next project should have been building out the API and model structure of the site. After fully understanding the data layout of the project we could properly design the site and componetize the application, so the third project could be building out the front-end with React. This layout of this project makes far more sense to me from my experience as a web developer. An MVP shouldn't be so different from the final form that it is almost unusable or requiring manual effort to copy and past html into React components. I am really excited for this project but the cluttered structure has made many of the parts feel confusing or 'for the sake of doing them' and not actually teaching us something about development.\"},{\"title\":\"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?\",\"body\":\"My tip of the week is to 'reinvent the wheel' as often as you can! Many people talk about this as if it is a bad thing or a waste of time. However as students and upcoming developers I believe it is our duty to try to copy or recreate the things we use to develop, so that we can truly understand why they do things the way they do or how they work. You aren't trying to compete with the thing you are using or replace it for yourself, you simply are breaking it down so far that you can truly understand it.\"}]},\"09172017\":{\"title\":\"Week 3\",\"subtitle\":\"Looking For a Job\",\"date\":\"September 17, 2017\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"What did you do this past week?\",\"body\":\"This past week was the career fair!

Whether its for the best or not the way our current recruiting system works favors those who practice one-off style algo and data structures problems. The more of these problems you do the better mindset you are in to tackle these types of complex bite-sized problems. I find that working or personal projects (the type of development most of us will do after school) doesn't lend itself to performing well in interviews so we need to supplement this with extra practice. Good luck to everyone going into interviews!!\"}]},\"09102017\":{\"title\":\"Week 2\",\"subtitle\":\"The Work Begins\",\"date\":\"September 10, 2017\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"What did you do this past week?\",\"body\":\"This past week I spent my time doing readings for classes, starting to work on collatz, and working on personal projects.

When working I had a consistent schedule and lots of free time, since all of my work got done during the day.

I have other homework that mostly involves reading for all of my classes so continuing to do that will be a common part of everyweek.\"},{\"title\":\"What's my experience of the class?\",\"body\":\"Overall I am excited for the class this semester. Right now its a bit dry since I took OOP and this project is the same as our starter project in that class. However after working this summer my thoughts around all of the scaffolding in the project have changed. When working on stories for work we go through the process of  estimating time, assigning champions to task them out, and giving them story points. In this class the process is quite different than in the workplace, its far more granular. If implementing a feature that found the max cycle length of a number the story would be more like this: Collatz would have a story point value of difficulty, probably a 1 - 3 just given where I worked. Then the story would have a simple description of the functionality and a set of 'acceptance criteria' to let you know the type of output it would have when finished. Then the champion would create subtasks which would be similar to our issues but more general; 1. Set up repository and CI  2. Write unit and acceptance tests  3. Implement logic  4. Manual testing (if necessary)  5. Code review  6. Deploy. The act of writing out a minimum of 15 issues is tedious and often ends up with the developer creating things simply for the sake of the task. I think the problem may be in that this project is supposed to simulate what an entire 'product' would look like when it is more the workload of a light story so coming up with all the subtasks seems extraneous. However the practice for anyone who has never had any experience doing something like this is better than nothing, it certainly taught me better in OOP. However I feel like the granularity of these projects pull people away from taking the skill into their own projects, and will end up with them worrying too much doing it wrong later in their career. I look forward to it in the web application though, however as that will be much more similar to a 'product'\"},{\"title\":\"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?\",\"body\":\"Contributing to open source is extremely valuable, but can be really scary to students or feel overwhelming. My tip (and sort of self promotion) is to find people similar to your age or position in life working on projects and help out with those. Working on open source doesn't always have to mean workin on some big product, finding a small, maybe less 'important' project can help get you started. Even similar to this is to be the catalyst to creating small projects, when you work on a project make it open source! Typically this is as easy as ensuring the code is on github and writing documentation on what you are doing. This is something I have been trying to do with all of my hobby projects, I am currently working on a small css-framework called KentCSS that I have open and avaliable to the public. I write documentation on the classes and am working on submission guidelines and tips to help people work on it if they find it interesting. Open source is more of an idea than a set of projects, help promote the culture of open source through all of your development!\"}]},\"09042017\":{\"title\":\"Week 1\",\"subtitle\":\"Beginning of the End\",\"date\":\"September 4, 2017\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"What are your expectations of the class?\",\"body\":\"As the first week of class has finished it is really starting to hit me that I am in my final year.

It interesting going back to totally static html, its something I haven't done it quite some time. I have been using angular and vuejs for sometime now but I haven't used facebooks React before for frontend. I started going to MAD's advanced web where they are going to be teaching React to hopefully catch myself up to where I am with other frameworks.\"},{\"title\":\"What's in your way?\",\"body\":\"Really nothing is in my way right now!\"},{\"title\":\"What will you do next week?\",\"body\":\"This next week I have an Information Retrieval project I will be working on. I will also be working to finish up the idb project. We need to work on our documentation write up and finish all of the front-end. Right now we have a lot of the 'infastructure' for the site working and just need to put in the sample data to show it off.\"},{\"title\":\"What's my experience of the class?\",\"body\":\"The class has been good so far, I am really enjoying learning more about python in lecture. The project is a bit sporadic. I feel like the requirements are all over the place and unclear in a lot of ways. While we were working in the lab today we had another group come up and ask us stuff about the project. They asked how we set up react and the database, we however were certain neither of those things were required for the first project and told them such. We later were told by another group that we did need to use react for part 1 of idb. After posting on Piazza, we found out this was not the case and told that group as well. The fact that 3 groups had different ideas about what part 1 was speaks to the layout of this project. Doing a static site first with fake data, but not requiring react, which will later be an integral part is strange which is why I believe it was so unclear. The layout of a site using a component based framework is VASTLY different than a static HTML only site. We are going to have to spend many man hours just reworking our site and componetizing parts before we can move on in the next project. I feel as though this project should have started with us getting a simple one page HTML site up and running using flask and Google Cloud Platform. Something as simple as the team name and photos. Then the next project should have been building out the API and model structure of the site. After fully understanding the data layout of the project we could properly design the site and componetize the application, so the third project could be building out the front-end with React. This layout of this project makes far more sense to me from my experience as a web developer. An MVP shouldn't be so different from the final form that it is almost unusable or requiring manual effort to copy and past html into React components. I am really excited for this project but the cluttered structure has made many of the parts feel confusing or 'for the sake of doing them' and not actually teaching us something about development.\"},{\"title\":\"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?\",\"body\":\"My tip of the week is to 'reinvent the wheel' as often as you can! Many people talk about this as if it is a bad thing or a waste of time. However as students and upcoming developers I believe it is our duty to try to copy or recreate the things we use to develop, so that we can truly understand why they do things the way they do or how they work. You aren't trying to compete with the thing you are using or replace it for yourself, you simply are breaking it down so far that you can truly understand it.\"}]},\"09172017\":{\"title\":\"Week 3\",\"subtitle\":\"Looking For a Job\",\"date\":\"September 17, 2017\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"What did you do this past week?\",\"body\":\"This past week was the career fair!

Whether its for the best or not the way our current recruiting system works favors those who practice one-off style algo and data structures problems. The more of these problems you do the better mindset you are in to tackle these types of complex bite-sized problems. I find that working or personal projects (the type of development most of us will do after school) doesn't lend itself to performing well in interviews so we need to supplement this with extra practice. Good luck to everyone going into interviews!!\"}]},\"09102017\":{\"title\":\"Week 2\",\"subtitle\":\"The Work Begins\",\"date\":\"September 10, 2017\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"What did you do this past week?\",\"body\":\"This past week I spent my time doing readings for classes, starting to work on collatz, and working on personal projects. Class is just getting started so the work load for everything is still pretty light, so I still have lots of time to work on my own development projects. I have also been working on getting my org ready for the semester and recruiting. I became the president of Design Collective this semester so that has taken up more time than my classes this week.\"},{\"title\":\"What's in your way?\",\"body\":\"Currently the only thing in my way is the mindset I had over the summer. When working I had a consistent schedule and lots of free time, since all of my work got done during the day.

I have other homework that mostly involves reading for all of my classes so continuing to do that will be a common part of everyweek.\"},{\"title\":\"What's my experience of the class?\",\"body\":\"Overall I am excited for the class this semester. Right now its a bit dry since I took OOP and this project is the same as our starter project in that class. However after working this summer my thoughts around all of the scaffolding in the project have changed. When working on stories for work we go through the process of  estimating time, assigning champions to task them out, and giving them story points. In this class the process is quite different than in the workplace, its far more granular. If implementing a feature that found the max cycle length of a number the story would be more like this: Collatz would have a story point value of difficulty, probably a 1 - 3 just given where I worked. Then the story would have a simple description of the functionality and a set of 'acceptance criteria' to let you know the type of output it would have when finished. Then the champion would create subtasks which would be similar to our issues but more general; 1. Set up repository and CI  2. Write unit and acceptance tests  3. Implement logic  4. Manual testing (if necessary)  5. Code review  6. Deploy. The act of writing out a minimum of 15 issues is tedious and often ends up with the developer creating things simply for the sake of the task. I think the problem may be in that this project is supposed to simulate what an entire 'product' would look like when it is more the workload of a light story so coming up with all the subtasks seems extraneous. However the practice for anyone who has never had any experience doing something like this is better than nothing, it certainly taught me better in OOP. However I feel like the granularity of these projects pull people away from taking the skill into their own projects, and will end up with them worrying too much doing it wrong later in their career. I look forward to it in the web application though, however as that will be much more similar to a 'product'\"},{\"title\":\"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?\",\"body\":\"Contributing to open source is extremely valuable, but can be really scary to students or feel overwhelming. My tip (and sort of self promotion) is to find people similar to your age or position in life working on projects and help out with those. Working on open source doesn't always have to mean workin on some big product, finding a small, maybe less 'important' project can help get you started. Even similar to this is to be the catalyst to creating small projects, when you work on a project make it open source! Typically this is as easy as ensuring the code is on github and writing documentation on what you are doing. This is something I have been trying to do with all of my hobby projects, I am currently working on a small css-framework called KentCSS that I have open and avaliable to the public. I write documentation on the classes and am working on submission guidelines and tips to help people work on it if they find it interesting. Open source is more of an idea than a set of projects, help promote the culture of open source through all of your development!\"}]},\"09042017\":{\"title\":\"Week 1\",\"subtitle\":\"Beginning of the End\",\"date\":\"September 4, 2017\",\"content\":[{\"title\":\"What are your expectations of the class?\",\"body\":\"As the first week of class has finished it is really starting to hit me that I am in my final year.

I have used many of the technologies or some variant of them through personal projects or internships, but with more practice comes better and better results. I also am looking forward to becoming proficient in python. While I have worked in the language before, I look forward to Downings very in depth look at the language.

I was dissapointed to see that the groups for the large project will be randomly assigned, as this project was a large reason for taking this class. I get that the random teams is supposed to simulate 'real life' better, but here where a big portion of it is coming up with the idea (unlike a real job where the idea is typically already with the team) I feel like it will stifle the creativity we will have. I think this because I wanted to go in with friends and acquaintances who have similar interests so we could work on something we all know a lot about and therefore be more creative.\"},{\"title\":\"What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?\",\"body\":\"My tip of the week is to make sure that you are really paying attention to you classes during syllabus week so you can figure out the work load and schedule you will have to keep throughout the semester.
